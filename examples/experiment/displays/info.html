        <h2>Welcome to the experiment!</h2>
        <p>
            This experiment aims to investigate how different ways of presenting a
            video with time delay effects user performance.
        </p>
        <p>
            You will soon be presented with a camera feed from a RC car similar to
            the one below. You control the car with the arrow keys on the keyboard.
        </p>
        <img src="/static/example.jpg">
        <p>
            One by one, in random order the round LED will light up. You shall then
            steer the robot such that center pin goes inside the corresponding
            hole.
            The LED will turn off when you have made the hit, and a new one
            will light up.
        </p>
        <!--<p>-->
            <!--One of the displays will have a red arrow as in the image below,-->
            <!--it describes the predicted position of the center pin.-->
        <!--</p>-->

        <h4>
            Your goal
        </h4>
        <p>
            In 90 seconds, your goal is to make as many "hits" as possible.
        </p>
        <h4>
            Last notes
        </h4>
        <p>
            Three different display types will be shown to you. You will be
            given a 30 seconds long "training period" to get used to
            steering the car before hits starts to count.
