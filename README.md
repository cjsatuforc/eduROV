# eduROV
Various eduROV related stuff.
The eduROV project is all about spreading the joy of technology and learning. 
The eduROV is being developed as a DIY ROV kit meant to be affordable and usable by schools, hobbyists, researchers and others as they see fit.
We are committed to be fully open-source, both software and hardware-wise, everything we develop will be available to you. Using other open-source and or open-acces tools and platforms.
