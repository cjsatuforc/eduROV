    <h2>Welcome to the experiment!</h2>
    <p>
        This experiment aims to investigate how different ways of presenting a
        video with time delay effects user performance.
    </p>
    <p>
        You will soon be presented with a camera feed from a RC car similar to
        the one below. You control the car with the arrow keys.

        One by one, in random order the round LED will light up. You shall then
        steer the robot such that black pin goes inside the corresponding hole.
    </p>
    <h3>
        Your goal
    </h3>
    <p>
        In 60 seconds, your goal is to make as many "hits" as possible.
    </p>
    <h3>
        Last notes
    </h3>
    <p>
        Two different display types will be shown to you. You will be given a
        30 seconds long "training period" to get used to the display before
        hits starts to count.
