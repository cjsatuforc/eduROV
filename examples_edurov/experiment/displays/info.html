        <h2>Welcome to the experiment!</h2>
        <p>
            This experiment aims to investigate how different ways of presenting a
            video with time delay effects user performance.
        </p>
        <p>
            You will soon be presented with a camera feed from a RC car similar to
            the one below. You control the car with the arrow keys on the keyboard.
        </p>

            One by one, in random order the round LED will light up. You shall then
            steer the robot such that black pin goes inside the corresponding hole.
        </p>
        <h4>
            Your goal
        </h4>
        <p>
            In 60 seconds, your goal is to make as many "hits" as possible.
        </p>
        <h4>
            Last notes
        </h4>
        <p>
            Two different display types will be shown to you. You will be given a
            30 seconds long "training period" to get used to the display before
            hits starts to count.
        </p>
