Getting started
================

.. TIP::
  If you came here to find out how to to use the Engage ROV submersible, the
  `Engage eduROV <http://edurov.readthedocs.io/en/latest/engage.html>`_ page
  is probably for you. If you instead plan to create your own ROV or make some
  kind of modifications, you are in the right place.

On this page we will walk through the
`features example <https://github.com/trolllabs/eduROV/tree/master/examples/features>`_,
one feature at a time. This example was created with the intention of
describing all the features of the edurov package. Let's get started!
