Getting started
================

.. TIP::
  If you came here to find out how to to use the Engage ROV submersible, the `Engage eduROV <http://edurov.readthedocs.io/en/latest/engage.html>`_ page is probably for you.
  If you instead plan to create your own ROV or make some kind of modifications, you are in the right place.
